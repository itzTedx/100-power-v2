    ## Product Overview
    POWER Booster is a complementary additive package that, through a micro-metallurgical process, forms (from the original metal) a durable, polished-like micro-layer of metal that dramatically resists wear, extreme pressure, and excessive temperature. Metal surfaces remain treated at all times, which provides for immediate start-up lubrication. 
    
    Friction is reduced by up to 95% and wear by up to 96%, which results in an estimated extension of the engine’s equipment's life of up to 10 times and an oil service life of up to 2-3 times, plus a major improvement in performance and fuel economy

    ## Key Benefits
    - Fuel Consumption: Reduces fuel usage by 15-25%
    - Wear Reduction: Decreases wear by over 96%
    - Extended Oil Change Intervals: Increases intervals by 2-3 times
    - Longer Equipment Life: Extends the service life by 5-8 times
    - Reduced Friction: Reduces metal-to-metal friction by up to 95%
    - Operational Cost Reduction: Cuts maintenance costs by up to 65%
    - Increased Productivity: Reduces downtime by up to 90%
    - Cleaner Emissions: Significant reduction in pollutant emissions
    - Reduced Waste Oil: Minimizes waste oil volumes
    - Less Replacement Parts: Considerably reduces the need for equipment replacements

        1. ### Check Compatibility
    
            Refer to your vehicle's manual to ensure Power 85W90 API SP meets the recommended specifications.
   
        2. ### Drain Old Oil
    
            Completely remove the old engine oil to prevent contamination and maintain optimal performance.
   
        3. ### Replace Oil Filter
    
            Always install a new oil filter before adding fresh oil for best results.
   
        4. ### Add Power Oil
    
            Pour the recommended quantity of Power 85W90 into the engine through the filler cap.
   
        5. ### Check Oil Level
    
            Use the dipstick to verify oil level and adjust as necessary before starting the engine.
   
        6. ### Run & Inspect
    
            Start the engine and let it idle briefly to circulate the oil, then check for leaks.
   
        7. ### Monitor Regularly
    
            Check oil levels periodically and top up if needed. Follow scheduled oil change intervals for extended engine life.
