  ## Product Overview
 100 Power AIROLUBE J1899-40 is an ashless dispersant oil specifically developed for aviation piston engines. It combines non-metallic additives with high-viscosity index base oils to provide exceptional stability, dispersancy, and anti-foaming performance. These additives leave no metallic ash residues that could lead to deposit formation in combustion chambers and on spark plugs, which can cause pre-ignition and possible engine failure.

  ## About Piston Engine Oil
  For generations, the aviation industry has put its trust in 100 Power piston engine oils to meet the exacting demands each aircraft piston engine places on its oil. And we continually innovate to offer superior products.

  Whether your power plant is air- or liquid-cooled; two- or four-stroke; geared or direct drive; gasoline or diesel-fuelled; or carburetted, fuel-injected, or turbocharged, there is a 100 Power piston engine oil specially formulated to look after your engine the way you look after your aircraft.
