  ## Product Overview
100 Power FlangeArmor RFL-S is a synthetic / semi-synthetic tacky oil engineered for extreme climates and heavy-duty rail operations. It delivers superior oxidation stability, a very low pour point for cold starts, and extended drain intervals, making it ideal for both passenger and freight locomotives.

  ## About Rail and Wheel Flange Oil
  100 Power Rail and Wheel Flange Oil is specially formulated to lubricate and protect rail heads, wheel flanges, and track contact surfaces. Designed for heavy-duty railway operations, it reduces friction, wear, and noise while providing excellent resistance to water, corrosion, and extreme temperatures. By ensuring smooth, reliable movement between wheels and rails, this oil helps extend component life, minimize maintenance, and improve overall operational efficiency in freight, passenger, and shunting locomotives.
