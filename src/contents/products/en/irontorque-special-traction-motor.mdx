  ## Product Overview
100 Power IronTorque Special Traction Motor / Insulated Gear Oil is
a specialty lubricant for locomotive traction motors and insulated
gears, delivering dielectric strength, oxidation stability, and wear
protection for safe, reliable performance under heavy rail loads

  ## About 100 Power IronTorque Gear and Traction Oil
  The 100 Power IronTorque series is developed for locomotive traction motors, gearboxes, and axle drives, where extreme loads, high torque, and severe vibration demand the highest protection. Formulated in mineral and synthetic variants across ISO VG and SAE multigrade options, IronTorque oils provide outstanding extreme-pressure performance, shear stability, and thermal resistance. They reduce gear wear, scuffing, and pitting while maintaining a strong lubricating film under heavy shock loads. With options ranging from standard-duty mineral oils to premium PAO synthetics, IronTorque ensures longer drain intervals, improved efficiency, and maximum reliability for both freight and passenger locomotives operating in diverse climates.

  ## Meet & Exceed
 - M-942 (insulated gear oils)
