        3. ### Replace Oil Filter
    
            Always install a new oil filter before adding fresh oil for best results.
   
        4. ### Add Power Oil
    
            Pour the recommended quantity of Power 85W90 into the engine through the filler cap.
   
        5. ### Check Oil Level
    
            Use the dipstick to verify oil level and adjust as necessary before starting the engine.
   
        6. ### Run & Inspect
    
            Start the engine and let it idle briefly to circulate the oil, then check for leaks.
   
        7. ### Monitor Regularly
    
            Check oil levels periodically and top up if needed. Follow scheduled oil change intervals for extended engine life.
