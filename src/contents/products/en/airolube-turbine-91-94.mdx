  ## Product Overview
100 Power AIROLUBE Turbine 91-94 is a 3 mm²/s synthetic diester oil incorporating a carefully selected and balanced combination of additives to improve thermal and oxidation stability and to increase the load-carrying ability of the base oil. With its much smaller viscosity increase of typically 2,000 cSt at –40°C, it can help to improve cold-soak start-up reliability and thus maximize ETOPS times, as it has significantly lower viscosity at cold-soak start-up temperatures (–40°C) than a standard 5-cSt oil.

  ## About Turbine Engine Oil
