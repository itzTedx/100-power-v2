            - ### Superior Wear Protection

                Forms a micro-layer on engine components to reduce friction and metal contact, providing lasting protection during cold starts and high-stress driving.

            - ### Enhanced Engine Efficiency

                Reduces internal drag for improved fuel economy, smoother acceleration, and optimal power delivery.

            - ### Prolonged Engine Life

                Minimizes wear and maintains component integrity, extending the lifespan of the engine even under demanding conditions.
    
            - ### Exceptional Cleanliness

                Advanced detergents break down sludge and deposits, keeping the engine clean and performing at its best.
    
            - ### Cooler Operating Temperatures

                Reduces friction-generated heat, helping the engine run cooler and preventing thermal breakdown.
    
            - ### Reliable Cold Start Protection

                Instant lubrication at startup ensures critical parts are protected during the most vulnerable moments. 
    
            - ### Lower Emissions

                Cleaner combustion and reduced sludge formation help minimize exhaust emissions for a more eco-friendly drive.
    
            - ### Water Contamination Resistance

                Protects the engine against performance loss caused by water ingress or condensation in the oil.

    <DirectionsTabs>
        1. ### Check Compatibility
    
            Refer to your vehicle's manual to ensure Power 20W40 API SP meets the recommended specifications.
   
        2. ### Drain Old Oil
    
            Completely remove the old engine oil to prevent contamination and maintain optimal performance.
   
        3. ### Replace Oil Filter
    
            Always install a new oil filter before adding fresh oil for best results.
   
        4. ### Add Power Oil
    
            Pour the recommended quantity of Power 20W40 into the engine through the filler cap.
   
        5. ### Check Oil Level
    
            Use the dipstick to verify oil level and adjust as necessary before starting the engine.
   
        6. ### Run & Inspect
    
            Start the engine and let it idle briefly to circulate the oil, then check for leaks.
   
        7. ### Monitor Regularly
    
            Check oil levels periodically and top up if needed. Follow scheduled oil change intervals for extended engine life.
