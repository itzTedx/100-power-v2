  ## Product Overview
  100 Power Airolube 46170 E is a synthetic hydrocarbon-based hydraulic fluid specifically inhibited to provide excellent oxidation stability for the oil and good corrosion preventive protection to the hydraulic system. Rust inhibitors are utilized to provide protection to ferrous components, and modern additive technology is employed for oxidative stability, corrosion inhibition, and anti-wear protection. AeroSyn 46170 is designated as a P-15 protectant according to the MIL-P-116G standard.

  ## About Hydraulic Fluids
  100 Power hydraulic fluids for aviation applications ensure the lubrication, robustness, and reliability of equipment. Their anti-wear, resistance to oxidation, corrosion protection, and high viscosity index properties make all our products exceed in many cases the requirements set forth in US and European standards.

  ## Meet & Exceed
  - MIL-PRF-461700 Type I*
  - NATO Code: H-544
