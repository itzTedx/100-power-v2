  ## Product Overview
  100 Power Air Compressor Series is a line of supreme performance oils primarily intended for the lubrication of severe duty rotary screw and vane air compressors. This product line is particularly suited for severe service where mineral oil-based products are not meeting expectations, such as in severe applications subjected to high final compression temperatures or where extended oil drain intervals are desired. Series formulated with wax-free synthetic hydrocarbon fluids and a high-technology additive system that assures exceptional resistance to oxidation and thermal degradation far superior to mineral oil-based air compressor oils. Series provide excellent wear protection and outstanding resistance to oxidation and thermal degradation, greatly superior to mineral oils. Their unique formulation provides the ability to reduce maintenance costs through minimizing equipment problems and downstream deposits and carryover.
