  ## Product Overview
  100 Power Airolube 83282 D is a synthetic hydrocarbon-based aircraft hydraulic fluid with greatly improved fire resistance characteristics and a high level of cleanliness when compared with conventional petroleum products. 100 Power Airolube is formulated for aircraft systems where the use of hydrocarbon-based hydraulic fluids is required. They are low-viscosity products, high VI (viscosity index) fluids with excellent low-temperature properties, good anti-wear performance, and good chemical stability.

  ## About Hydraulic Fluids
  100 Power hydraulic fluids for aviation applications ensure the lubrication, robustness, and reliability of equipment. Their anti-wear, resistance to oxidation, corrosion protection, and high viscosity index properties make all our products exceed in many cases the requirements set forth in US and European standards.
