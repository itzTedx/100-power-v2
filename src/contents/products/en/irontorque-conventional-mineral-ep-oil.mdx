  ## Product Overview
100 Power IronTorque Conventional Mineral EP Oil is a reliable
mineral-based gear oil for standard duty traction systems,
delivering wear protection, oxidation resistance, and gear
cleanliness at a cost-effective level.

## About 100 Power IronTorque Gear and Traction Oil
The 100 Power IronTorque series is developed for locomotive traction motors, gearboxes, and axle drives, where extreme loads, high torque, and severe vibration demand the highest protection. Formulated in mineral and synthetic variants across ISO VG and SAE multigrade options, IronTorque oils provide outstanding extreme-pressure performance, shear stability, and thermal resistance. They reduce gear wear, scuffing, and pitting while maintaining a strong lubricating film under heavy shock loads. With options ranging from standard-duty mineral oils to premium PAO synthetics, IronTorque ensures longer drain intervals, improved efficiency, and maximum reliability for both freight and passenger locomotives operating in diverse climates.
