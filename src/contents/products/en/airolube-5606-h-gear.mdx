  ## Product Overview
  100 Power Airolube 5606 H is a hydraulic fluid (MIL-PRF-5606) to which additional additives have been added to improve the fluid’s natural lubricity and is suitable for low-temperature operations. The lubricity agent provides a stable thin film layer on the metal surfaces under mild operating conditions. When severe conditions exist (landing/touchdown), the extreme pressure additive supplies the load carrying needed at the metal-to-metal surfaces to prevent the occurrence of such phenomena as “ladder cracking” and “slip stiction” of the piston component of the landing gear.

  ## About Gear Fluids
  100 Power gear fluids for aviation applications ensure the lubrication, robustness, and reliability of equipment. Their anti-wear, resistance to oxidation, corrosion protection, and high viscosity index properties make all our products exceed in many cases the requirements set forth in US and European standards.
